# MongoDB and Mongoose

## NoSQL vs. SQL

* List five differences between SQL and NoSQL
  * Relational database vs. non-relational or distributed database
  * Table based databses vs. key-value pairs, graph databses, or wide-column stores
  * Rigid schema vs. dymanic schema
  * Vertically scalable vs. Horizontally scalable
  * Structured Query Language (hence SQL) va. Unstructured Query Language ( UnQL)
  * MySQL, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres, MS-SQL vs. MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDb
  * More powerful vs. Less powerful for complex searches

* What kind of data is a good fit for a SQL database?
  * Relational with room for large numbers of transactions
* Give a real world example
* What kind of data is a good fit for a NoSQL database?
  * Hierarchical data
* Give a real world example.
* Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
  * NoSQL
* Which type of database is best for scalability?
  * NoSQL

* What does SQL stand for?
  * Structured Query Language
* What is a relational databse?
  * Tables can be connected via relations where a field in one table will be a key (unique identifier) in another table to form an abstract link between both sets of data.
* What type of structure does a relational database work with?
  * A schema.
* What is a 'schema'?
  * A strict format for each record or entry
* How does it work?
* What is inside of a MongoDB database?
  * A collection of documents
* Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB and why?
  * Depends on what you want to be flexible in.  More flexible in terms of changing root data then SQL. More flexible in terms of schema or getting information into the DB the first time, then MongoDB.
* What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
  * Data updates are a pain and data is stored in multiple places instead of one
