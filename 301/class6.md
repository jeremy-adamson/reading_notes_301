# Class 6 - NODE.JS

## An introduction to Node.js

* What is node.js?
  * An event-based, non-blicking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JS engine and libuv library.
* In your own words, what is Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine?
  * From the sound of it, it's a JS complier that goes straight into assembly
* What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
  * The software platform on which the JS is being executed.  For JS it's typically either in the browser or in Node.
* What is npm?
  * Node Package Manager - a library and registry for JavaScript software packages
* What version of node are you running on your machine?
  * 18.7.0
* What version of npm are you running on your machine?
  * 8.15.0
* What command would you type to install a library/package called 'jshint'?
  * npm install -g jshint
* What is node used for?
  * Running and installing various build tools to automate the process of developing JS applications.

## Reasons for Pair Programming

* What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
  * Greater Efficiency
  * Engaged Collaboration
  * Learning From Fellow Students
  * Social Skills
  * Job Interview Readiness
  * Work Environment Readiness
* In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
  * It really depends on the skill level of the person I am paired up with. In the best of cases I would say engaged collaboration would be the most beneficial part where two people come up with two separate (but valid) methods for solving a particular situation.
* How does pair programming work?
  * One person is the driver - actual coding/the person typing on the keyboard entering the commands (managing micro)
  * One person is the navigator - planning and communicating where the program is going, identifying typos, concentrating on program flow (managing macro)
