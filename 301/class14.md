# Diversity and Inclusion in the Tech Industry

* What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
  * A surge in media glorifying males playing and tinkering with personal computers at young ages.
* Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  * Males had a head start in understanding computer systems over those who did not have constant access to them.
* When are diversity efforts most successful?
  * When they are driven by commitment from the company leaders
* Why do diverse companies perform better?
  * Overall different points of view get to be included which can increase overall value.
* Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa?
  * It would be pretty funny for a room full of white guys to try and come up with ways to sell products to the general population. Appeal to a more diverse audience and the funds will flow.
