# Class 1 - Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

* What is a "component"?
  * A component is an encapsulated software object and often relies on inheritance
* What are the characteristics of a components?
  * The characteristics of a component include:
    * Reusability
    * Replaceable
    * Non-context specific
    * Extensible (inheritance)
    * Encapsulated
    * Independent
* What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
  * The advantages of component based architecture include:
    * Ease of deployment - modular for updates
    * Reduced cost
    * Ease of development - again, modular so it's easy to split up the work between different groups
    * Modification of technical complexity
    * Reliabilty
    * System maintenance and evolution
    * Independent

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

* What is "props" short for?
  * Props stands for properties of the object in question (ie this.)
* How are props used in React?
  * Properties are used to pass data from one component to the next
* What is the flow of props?
  * The flow of props is always from parent to child (or one directional)
