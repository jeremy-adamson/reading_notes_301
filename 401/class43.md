# Open-Source Software Contribution

## Prompt

Open source contributing can yield a number of benefits for both the origanization (or person) requiesting for help and for the developer wanting to put themselves out there. Some insidviduals will do it just for the puzzels or for the desire to help others while other developers can use this as a way to jumpstart a career through recognition, practice, and being able to show/demonstrate to others their abilities. Some of the pitfalls to this is that companies or organizations are basically getting work done for free by others who are willing to volunteer their time while be able to make a profit off of the contributions made.
