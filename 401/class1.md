* On the other hand it is important to keep moving forward without staying in one place too long
* When stuck, reach out for help to avoid needless suffering

* What's your perspective?
* Why are you doing this?
  * Several reasons including learning a common programming language, brushing off the dust from an antiquated skill-set from two decades ago, setting myself up for entry into a MS CS program at a university, coding can be fun, income difference vs. engineering, code worked on and algorithms developed will not directly contribute to potential loss of life when implimented.
* Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
  * There's an end? The journey never stops when it comes to learning.
* Are you doing this for you?
  * There are reasons both internal and external

## Big O

* General Big O notation
  * Get rid of constant coefficients and added constants
  * Gives an approximate order of magnitude when it comes to number of operations for a particular search/sort/algorithm
* Splitting it up into the most common runtimes
  * O(1)
  * O(log N)
  * O(N)
  * O(N log N)
  * O(N^2)
  * O(2^N)
