# DSA Review

## Questions

* What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the "Whiteboard Advice" reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?
  * Restate the question to ensure that you heard the question correctly and iron out any details that you may have missed.
  * Ask about edge cases on the inputs/outputs
  * Ask about test cases
  * Write Pseudocode and ask if it makes sense (since it's all about being able to communicate effectively)
  * Coding it up and then asking if it looks okay
  * It is okay to ask for a slight nudge in a particular direction if you end up getting stuck

* From the "6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview" article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performace during a whiteboard programming interview?
  * Probably taking a few minutes and saying that you're taking a few minutes to think of the solution to the problem to literally explain that you are taking a pause instead of having dead silence without a reason for it.
  * It is okay to just handwave some of the exact syntax (which I was doing but good to know it's perfectly valid)

* What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstraucted video?
  * Mostly that it's better to be very strong in the basics instead of mostly okay at a number of various topics
