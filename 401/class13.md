# Linear Regressions

## Questions

* Can you explain the concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and the data analysis.

  * Linear regressions are simple ways to identify if two different data sets may be related, what the relation is, and how strong they may be related to each other

* Describe the process of implementing a linear regression podel using Python's Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.
  * Import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model
  * Create two numpy arrays
  * Instantiate a linear regression model via .fit()
  * Other functions are available from there between r values to the m/b of the regression line
  * predict() will be f(x) of the regression line from the set

* What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does thie contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model's performance?
  * Train and test exist to allow the model to "learn" and grow after the initial data sets have been used to create the original model
