# Serverless Functions

## Reading Questions

* What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?
  * Unsure about the key characteristics but from the sources serverless simply means not having a dedicated server that's always up and running waiting just fo ryour input alone and instead is a virtual ball of event listeners which can execute the function you call upon when you call upon it.
* How can one get started with Vercel and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?
  * Mostly sign up, have a repo in github, link Vercel to the desired repo via import, then click deploy.
* What are APIs and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?
  * An API is an interface which can be called upon as a go between from client to server. In Python, requests is the library which needs to be imported for API calls to function.
* What is the Requests library in Python and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?
  * Requests basically takes care of the heavy lifting when it comes to typical REST functionality.
