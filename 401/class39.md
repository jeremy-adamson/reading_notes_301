# React Part 3

## Reading Questions

* What is React Context and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?
  * React Context is a method of passing information from one component to another without having to drill down multiple levels through using props.

* Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React context within a functional component.
  * From my understanding, useContext Hook is the way of creating a segment of information (context object/component), storing the information, and then retrieving the information in a separate component.

* Describe the purpose of Next.js and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.
