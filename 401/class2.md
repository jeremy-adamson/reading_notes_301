# Testings and Modules

## Testing Notes

* TDD - Test driven development
  * In all honesty I'll have to read this section 10 more times
  * In my current poisition we write software requirements and verification parameters before even handing it off to software
  * The idea of having a specific rubric (tests) to write towards does provide a bit more direction
  * But yes this reading will be revisited

## Other Reading notes

* `__name__ == "__main__"`
  * For the most part it ensures that the code being run is a script call instead of being an imported module
  * Fairly important standardized segment to include in scripts

* A bit familiar with recursion at the moment although the big question right now is how to pair it up with memoization which I'm a bit less well versed in.
  * A few takeaways though
    * Recursive approaches take more time and space vs. iterative
    * Recursion can is a bit more elegant in terms of the code
