# Classes, Objects, and Recursion

## Classes and Objects

* As per most languages, the keyword for defining a class is `class`
* `self` is used as the first parameter in a method
* Variables and methods are called the same as other languages
* `__init__()` is the constructor

## Recursion

* Recursion is recursion
* The values have to be passed or mantained in a global that is referenced
* Don't cause a stack overflow (too many instances of the function)

## Pytest

* Fixtures are functions which will run before each test function to which it is applied. Can help with cleaning up the output.
