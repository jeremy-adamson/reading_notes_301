# Cryptography

## Reading questions

* What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher and how was it used historically?
  * The Caesar Cipher was basically a letter shift algorithm where the letters were shifted in one direction by a designated number of slots.
* What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?
  * Symmetric encryption is basically one to one meaning that the algorithm or key is shared and the same method of encrypting is the same method for decrypting. For asymmetric encryption, the method is not the same which allows for either an encrypted message to be decrypted by many different methods (ie electronic signatures) or having an easily encrypted multi method message only able to be decrypted by fewer or one method(s).
* How do computers generate random numbers and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and psudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cyptography.
  * True random number generation involved actual random numbers (ie rolling a die a certain number of times) however computers aren't able to produce a 100% random number of events but instead take various information which is available form time to amount of memory currently being used to seed a start location on a "random" number table or algorithm.
* What is the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.
  * Encryption is scrambling up the message so that others may not be able to read it while decryption is taking the scrambled message and reversing the encryption process thus making the message readable again.
