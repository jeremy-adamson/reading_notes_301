# Data Analysis

## Reading Questions

* What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it different from Jupyter Notebook?

  * Jupyter Notebook is a base level version of Jupyter Lab and can only deal with creation and sharing of individual notebooks with a simpler interface.
  * Jupyter Lab is a development environment for data scientists and programmers which includes a multi-document interface, and extension system, and notebook compatibility.

* What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?

  * The main areas of NumPy which would be of concern to myself would be:
    * Multi-dimensional arrays
    * Mathematical functions (primarily fsolve)
  * It also includes methods for visualization of data and plotting as needed.

* Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide example of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.
  * NumPy arrays must only be of the same data type throughout
  * The arrays must be of a fixed size at the time of creation for memory allocation reasons
  * Multi-dimensional, but most arrays can be made multi-dimensional typically
  * Basically they treat arrays as matricies in terms of mapping fucntions over them
