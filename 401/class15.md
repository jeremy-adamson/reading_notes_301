# Trees

## Reading notes

* Terms which I did not know before:
  * K - The maximum number of childern of a particular node
  * Leaf - Endpoint or a node without children
  * Edge - The link between nodes
* Concepts I did not know before:
  * Implimentation of depth first is analogous to a stack
  * Implimentation of breadth first is analogous to a queue

## Reading Assignment (Quiz)

* What is the structure of a node in an K-ary tree?
* Why is recursion typically used when doing a depth-first traversal?
* Is a breadth first traversal more analagous to a queue or a stack?
* The base node is typically called what?
* What is the primary defining characteristic of a binary search tree?
* What is the purpose of having a binary search tree in terms of time complexity?
