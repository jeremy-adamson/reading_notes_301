# Recursion and Data Structures

* What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
  * How the individual pieces of information within the structure are going to be used as to limit the runtime needed (and sometimes space)
* How can we ensure that we'll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
  * Having a base case which tells the function to stop or 'unwind' typically through returns
