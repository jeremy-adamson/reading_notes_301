# Practice in the Terminal

## The command line

* The command line is a text based interface to the system (basically DOS back in the day).
* Each entry needs to have a command and can be followed up with options and arguments
* Echo is a little bit of a mystery still.

## Basic Navigation

* pwd or print working directory displays where you currently are in reference to root
* ls or list will print out what is in the current directory
* -l is the long listing which contains additional information on the listing
* absolute and relative paths are pretty straightforward. Absolute is in reference to the root and relative is in reference to where you're currently at.
* `~` is used to reference root or home
* `.` references the current directory or multiple to reference the directories above current
* cd to change directory

## More about Files

* Directory names may have spaces in them but when being referenced they must have tic marks around such a name.
* `\` is an escape character

## Manual Pages

* man command to give documentation on the command in question `q` to quit the page
