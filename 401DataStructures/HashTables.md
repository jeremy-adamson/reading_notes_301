# Hash Tables

## Quiz

* What would typically be the last step in a hash function for values which have a maximum length of 16 digits and a hash size of 64?

* If a filled hash table has 5 elements all collided on one address with a hash size of 10, what is the current load factor?

* What would be the big-O lookup time for a value in a hash table if every inserted value collided and collisions were resolved using linked lists?

* What is a downside of using a hash table over a linked list or list (array)?

* Given that hash functions are intended to avoid as many collisions for a bucket key as possible, why is the random number generator not used in a hash function to ensure each key is unique?
